They are intended to attract a diverse pool of applicants and historically have accommodated students from outside their zone or district. While some schools may have the word \"magnet\" in their school's name, only a school that currently gets Magnet Schools Assistance Program (M.S.A.P) funding is labeled as a \"magnet school\" on it's MySchools page. This magnet school offers a school-wide curriculum around the theme of Art and Science. Our mission at P.S. 245 is to provide each student with engaging learning experiences and a rigorous educational program. Our goal is to empower each student to grow intellectually and socially and to ensure that each student graduates on a pathway to a rewarding career, long-term economic security and equipped to be a positive force for change\t\t\t\n\nDue to our unique small school size, it allows us to know each child closely. Students are provided with a nurturing academic and safe learning environment. Small group instruction takes place in every classroom, every day. During this time. students are provided with tailored differentiated instruction to meet their individual needs. \n\nOur school has a full-time guidance counselor and social worker who works in collaboration with classroom teachers to provide a supportive school community for all of our students. Each student will participate in PE, art and music classes throughout the year as well several school-wide events such as our Thanksgiving Feast, Holiday shows &Spring Fling. ",

While some schools may have the word \"magnet\" in their school's name, only a school that currently gets Magnet Schools Assistance Program (M.S.A.P) funding is labeled as a \"magnet school\" on it's MySchools page. This magnet school offers a school-wide curriculum around the theme of Leadership Development and the Arts.

            "overview": "PS 256 was built in 1959, and has always been an active participant in the Bedford-Stuyvesant community. Our school is named after Benjamin Banneker, a Black astronomer, naturalist, surveyor, and almanac author.  Directly across from the school lies the Hattie Carthan Community Garden. Facing the school, on its north side, is the Marcy Pool. About a half block east lie the Magnolia Tree Earth Center and Von King Park. These landmarks exemplify Bed-Stuy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-standing sense of community activism, self-determination and pride that are still prevalent today, even as the neighborhood experiences a demographic and economic shift. At PS 256, we embrace this thriving culture and are a part of it ourselves.\n\nWe are a non-zoned, public New York City Magnet School. Magnet schools are part of a select network of schools that offer innovative theme-based programs. As a Magnet school, we incorporate our theme of architecture and engineering into  our  interdisciplinary units of study rooted in Science & Social Studies concepts.\n\nFor Reading & Writing, we use EL Education, a content-based curriculum organized around themes. Students build background knowledge by reading about a range of topics. They then use that knowledge to build writing skills across the genres. In addition, we use the Eureka Math Curriculum, Amplify Science and Passport to Social Studies. \n\n\nOur school's core values are equity, joy, collaboration and community.  These values are woven throughout the curriculum and show up in our approach to teaching and learning. \n",

We believe that relationships are central to nurturing a sense of agency and intellectual engagement and are committed to building a school community that values all of its members and their ever-changing needs. We know the vision must be collectively owned so that all voices are heard, and perspective is developed.  Every aspect of our school building should reflect equitable spaces that are socially, emotionally, and academically responsive to the community.  \n\n \nPS 261 is a part of the Boerum Hill community in Brooklyn in District 15. It has been a model of integration through its natural diversity, a goal the DOE strives to achieve in all schools across the city.  The school program as we know it today was developed through a parent initiative that wanted to bring rich learning experiences to all students, not just certain populations.  The active involvement of all stakeholders remains a critical part of the community.  Through committee work that includes both staff and parents (e.g., the Equity Team, Instructional Leadership Team, True Colors club, Social Action Committee, STEM committee, Health and Wellness Team), 261 strives to not only meet the social, emotional, and academic needs of students but do this work using a lens that honors diversity, equity, inclusion, and social justice.\n\n",
