We are a safe, nurturing, respectful learning community where students are encouraged to purposefully explore and innovate through technology, both independently and cooperatively.\n\nOur students are unique individuals with diverse learning styles who are socially and emotionally responsive. They are challenged with rigorous curricula and supported as they become our future leaders of tomorrow. Our students are problem solvers, collaborators, and inventors. They think critically and ask questions as they develop a love for learning that will enable them to adapt to change and persevere through challenges.\n\nAs the 21st Century continues to evolve, we are committed to enhancing, improving, engaging and stimulating a learning environment that is accessible for all students.\n\nThrough the dedication of our school staff, the support of our parents, and the partnerships we create within our community, our students will leave us as culturally and linguistically diverse individuals that are prepared for their future. Elm Tree Elementary School believes that planning for success in the future means working together today. This school has a Bilingual Special Education (BSE) program: Open to students recommended for Bilingual Special Education (BSE) on their Individualized Education Plan (IEP).

We expect the PEP to vote on this proposal on December 18. If this proposal is approved, any families with students who applied to M.S. 394 will have that choice removed from their Kindergarten applications.

Through our core values of Vision, Opportunity, Independence, Collaboration, and Expression, our school community strives to use Safety, Teamwork, Actions, and Respect to reach their full potential.\n\nOne of the most promising instructional practices is empowering students, staff and families to be leaders in education. Students have many opportunities to have a voice and choice in their instruction. They can develop lesson plans, create resources, lead a small group, assess themselves and their peers, and reflect on their performance. Through this coaching model, students deepen and strengthen their content knowledge while developing their confidence and honing their leadership skills.\n\nTeachers are empowered to be leaders as well. Through extensive professional development opportunities, teachers deepen their content knowledge and are \u00e2\u0080\u009cleads\u00e2\u0080\u009d for other teachers. Leads develop the units of study and lead the admin periods where they review the units, resources, and instructional practices that will be employed in the upcoming units. In addition, teachers welcome their colleagues into their classrooms to observe promising practices. \n\nLike staff and students, families are invited to be leaders in the school community. Through our committees and focus groups, we readily implement feedback and utilize the talents of our families to strengthen the relationship between home and school. Families have presented read alouds, shared cultural traditions, and explained their professions.\n\nAt PS 9 we are extremely proud of the culture of empowerment we have established where everyone can \u00e2\u0080\u009cBe a PS 9 STAR.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n This school has ASD Nest: Open to students currently enrolled in the ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) Nest program. If you are applying to ASD programs for the first time, please visit www.schools.nyc.gov/specializedprograms for the application and contact ASDprograms@schools.nyc.gov with questions.",

As such, our children are exposed to Music, Drama, Dance, Visual Arts, and authentic, hands-on  learning experiences throughout the day. \n-OPEN DOOR FOR FAMILIES In line with our beliefs that all members of our  community are teachers, we partner with our families in ways that contribute directly to  increasing student achievement and growth. \n-SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING Finally, because we believe that who a child is should  be as important as what they know, we prioritize their emotional and social development. By  actively modeling and celebrating the DRIVE values of Determination, Respect, Integrity, Voice,  and Engagement, we empower students to be their best--for themselves and for their community. \n-EXTENDED LEARNING With two strong CBO partnerships (Molding Lives for 3K and Pre-K and Roads to Success for K-5), we are able to provide over 200 students extended learning time and enrichment until 5:30PM.
