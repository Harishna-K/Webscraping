            "overview": "PS/IS 229K continues to provide an academically rigorous education, while at the same time offering diverse opportunities for acceleration and enrichment. Three out of the previous four years, we had a 100% pass rate for the Algebra I Regents and/or the Living Environment Regents. Most recently, 30% of our grade eight students received offers for Specialized High Schools or to competitive specialized programs at other top high schools, including Stuyvesant, LaGuardia, and Goldstein. We will be adding the Spanish Proficiency in spring 2024 and the U.S. History Regents in spring 2026.\n\nIn addition to the opportunity for high school credit through Regents-level coursework in mathematics and science, students have top-notch instruction in ELA, social studies, and the arts, which also serves as a springboard for specialized high schools and college preparation. We continue to offer additional electives including Pre-Med and STEAM. For the upcoming 2023-24 school year and beyond, we are developing a 21st century Digital Media and Journalism program. Our library is undergoing a tremendous upgrade that will turn the space into a true multi-media center to include STEAM lab, digital recording/editing room, and podcast studio. Partnering with both PBS News Hour\u2019s Student Reporting Labs and Story Maker, along with local colleges/universities, our staff and students will be more than able to raise their voices and be heard on a variety of topics and issues.\n\nOur focus on enrichment in addition to intervention gives students a chance to participate in even more diverse areas of interest. Our staff and students have collaborated on such varying enrichment opportunities as: Mad Science, Debate, Scrabble, Gardening, Tennis, Band/Orchestra, and Community Service. Our school continues to have a strong community service focus, with staff, students, and families alike, giving back. We recently donated over 140 pounds of canned and packaged foods through our \u201cSouper Bowl\u201d drive. Participating in the St. Jude Children\u2019s Hospital Math-a-Thon, we had an established goal of raising $4,000.\nThe amazing students, families, and staff exceeded that goal five times over, by raising just over $20,000!!!\n\nOur students and staff are also proud to take part in a number of District 20 initiatives that also shine a light on their many talents. These include the district STEAM Expo, in which all of our third grade through eighth grade students develop a project by going through the engineering and design process. We have had a group of students meet and exceed the challenge of participating in the MOEMS\u2019 Math Olympiad. With the Project Soapbox introduced in grades one, four, and eight, we will be expanding participation to all grades. Students engage in a multi-step process to identify and research an issue of interest, with the goal of developing a short speech to motivate the community to act for change.\n\nWe would love to have your student join our PS/IS 229K community to gain perspective, grow their voice, and show the world the power of a well-rounded, top-quality education.\n No additional priority is given to zoned students for the Gifted & Talented program at this school.",
