PS/MS 278 is a small K-8 community where each student is known well.  Our vision is to cultivate the seeds of real-world success within each student, fostering a transformative journey that prepares them to thrive in a rapidly evolving global landscape. Our students step confidently onto the path of high school and beyond, armed with the skills, knowledge, and character to excel as leaders, critical thinkers, and compassionate human beings. In achieving this, we not only realize our vision but also honor our collective responsibility to shape a brighter future for all.\u00c2\u00a0 \n\nIn addition to our visual arts program and performing arts residencies, our school is a School Wide Enrichment  Model (SEM) School. Through this program, students join faculty-led enrichment clusters which meet weekly during  the school day. Enrichment Cluster projects, field trips, and activities derive from student  interests. Many of our enrichment clusters are service-related or have artistic components.\n\nWe have expanded after-school programming to create space for all K-8 students to remain in building until 5:00 pm Monday \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Friday.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to offer our tradition of after-school academic\u00c2\u00a0and Title III language\u00c2\u00a0supports during the school week, on Saturdays, and during the vacation breaks.\u00c2\u00a0Our robust after school cub offerings include dance, art, STEM club, Chess, Violin, competitive basketball team, volleyball, and much more!",

            "overview": "Children at P.S. 3 - Independence\nP.S. 3 provides children with a vibrant learning environment that nurtures their intellectual, social, physical and emotional growth. Children learn through hands-on involvement with subjects and materials that are connected to the world around them. Teachers and staff members at P.S. 3 actively encourage children to take initiative, be resourceful, and show independence and discernment in their classroom work. At P.S. 3, children collaborate and communicate with fellow students of all ages. Our mission at P.S. 3 is to encourage all children to become confident self-motivated lifelong learners, and inspire them to become compassionate human beings.\n\n\nTeaching and Learning - Innovation\nAt P.S. 3, the integrated arts curriculum teaches children to examine their world from a broader perspective, deepening their academic curiosity and love of learning. The attention to STEM and Social Studies as a domain integrated with literacy stimulates engagement and challenges all learners. Teachers meet regularly to exchange ideas on the best learning tools, practices, and impact on student learning. By maintaining a responsive educational model, teachers are able to provide instruction and support that corresponds to students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 individual needs. The teachers at P.S. 3 place a high value on academic standards and risk taking, while honoring the diverse approaches, backgrounds, and contexts that students require to learn and grow successfully.\n\n\nCommunity\n\u00e2\u0080\u008eThe concept of community is paramount to PS3\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity. We focus on our relationships with each other, the surrounding neighborhood, our city, and the world at large. Bias free learning and a respect for others is the foundation for meaningful education. Empathy and understanding for a range of experiences is embedded in curriculum and honored as lived experiences. We utilize concepts \u00e2\u0080\u009cbig and small\u00e2\u0080\u009d to develop empathy and respect, while nurturing individual curiosity and driving a passion for learning inside and outside of school. Finally, children at PS3 develop the capacity to embrace a greater understanding of the world, to celebrate difference, and to strive to be of service to local and global communities.\n The Autism Horizon Program supports students with autism in a special class with eight students, a special education teacher and paraprofessional with emphasis on building skills and offering opportunities for meaningful inclusion in larger settings. Students in this program may need additional academic support and require speech and language services, including in areas of social or pragmatic communication.
