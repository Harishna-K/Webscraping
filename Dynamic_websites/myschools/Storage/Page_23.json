            "overview": "Magnet schools are public school options that provide a school-wide curriculum designed around a specific theme. They are intended to attract a diverse pool of applicants and historically have accommodated students from outside their zone or district. While some schools may have the word \"magnet\" in their school's name, only a school that currently gets Magnet Schools Assistance Program (M.S.A.P) funding is labeled as a \"magnet school\" on it's MySchools page. This magnet school offers a school-wide curriculum around the theme of Environmental Studies and Community Wellness. Nestled in the vibrant community of Coney Island, Brooklyn, PS 90 is a dedicated Magnet School focused on Environmental Studies and Community Wellness.
