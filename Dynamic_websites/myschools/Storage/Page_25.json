            "overview": "SISCL is founded on the fundamental belief that individuals must be educated for citizenship from the time they are very young, and must be vested in the public good and success of the community in order to make a difference.  Our goal is to begin with great kids, then build a great school, a great community, and a great nation.  Our students will at the same time build their personal and private excellences, and the courageous leadership skills that promote effective public performance and service.  We are focused on fostering a culture of excellence in the acquisition of essential skills in all educational disciplines through a highly structured, highly motivational school-wide Next Generation Learning Standards based- curriculum that encourages diversity in learning styles and the needs, interests and abilities of individual learners.  We are founded on the belief that civic leadership is education in action for the good of the all people within a global society.  As such, our students will develop the skills they need to make informed decisions as independent critical thinkers who understand their democratic rights as private individuals and their civic responsibilities as public participants in a network of communities.  An instructional emphasis is on diversity in learning styles in Triad Learning Communities.   Family partnerships are embedded directly in the foundation of our school.  We believe that in order for our children to be the courageous leaders of tomorrow, they need sustained integration of timeless leadership principles directly into the day to day curriculum.  We are implementing the Franklin Covey The Leader In Me Program, a school-based leadership process based on Stephen Covey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.  ",

We believe that children are creators of meaning in their own lives. They are naturally thoughtful and curious, and they work to gain understanding of the world they inhabit. When the adults who care for children foster this effort, children become life-long learners.  \r\n\r\nWe are a diverse community and our instruction is experiential and hands on with a standards based curriculum that also focuses on children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s individual needs. Adults model life-long learning by engaging in ongoing professional development and our governance structure assures collaboration among families, staff and administration.",
