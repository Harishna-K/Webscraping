Having collaborative discussion will allow our students to work together on existing and new ideas/inquiry, which will provide opportunities for input and feedback. As a result, our students will assume shared responsibilities and contribute to accomplishing common goals in meaningful and respectful ways. \n\n*Multi-Facet Engagement- Students show their thinking and learning in a creative and expressive manner. The teacher plays the role of a facilitator as students take ownership of their learning. Students use accountable talk, academic vocabulary, to challenge one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thinking. Through daily problem solving, synthesizing of information and exploration, students will experience learning in new and remarkable ways. \n\n*Differentiated instruction \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Each student has a unique learning style and interest. We provide students with varying avenues and opportunities for learning. Through continuous data driven instruction, we address various learning needs and develop personalized instruction so that ALL students can learn effectively. \n\n*Rigorous Opportunities \u00e2\u0080\u0093 By providing a set of intentionally aligned components, we create learning outcomes that offer engaging experiences and instructional strategies into an organized sequential unit of study.
