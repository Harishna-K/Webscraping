We offer Dual Language English & Spanish programs and Gifted and Talented classes for grades K-5, supporting an inclusive and culturally rich curriculum.\n\nOur students engage in authentic, inquiry-based learning that fosters critical thinking, collaboration, and exploration of real-world issues. Our science lab features a hydroponic garden, where students explore sustainable agriculture and plant science hands-on, connecting their learning to larger environmental concepts. Additionally, students develop environmental awareness and stewardship skills in our community garden on Himrod and Wilson Avenue. Our arts programming provides multiple opportunities throughout the school year for students to express themselves creatively. Through our theater program, students explore storytelling and performance, building confidence and collaboration skills. Our dance program encourages physical expression and fosters a sense of community among students as they celebrate diverse styles and cultures. Our media arts program fosters creative expression across multiple media forms, helping students develop a range of artistic skills. The STEAM club provides unique opportunities for students to compete in Minecraft coding challenges across NYC. Additionally, our soccer club offers students the chance to engage beyond the school walls by participating in tournaments around Brooklyn, building teamwork and sportsmanship.\n No additional priority is given to zoned students for the Gifted & Talented program at this school.",
