In collaboration with families, staff, and the students themselves, we empower students to become leaders in their school, their community, and the world. The Autism Horizon Program supports students with autism in a special class with eight students, a special education teacher and paraprofessional with emphasis on building skills and offering opportunities for meaningful inclusion in larger settings. Students in this program may need additional academic support and require speech and language services, including in areas of social or pragmatic communication.
