While some schools may have the word \"magnet\" in their school's name, only a school that currently gets Magnet Schools Assistance Program (M.S.A.P) funding is labeled as a \"magnet school\" on it's MySchools page. This magnet school offers a school-wide curriculum around the theme of Discovery School for Inquiry and Research: STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics).
