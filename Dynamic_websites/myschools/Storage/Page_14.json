Belief that all individuals are capable of learning and are entitled to opportunities needed to fulfill their individual potential and become lifelong learners. As well as a belief that creative expression is a basic human need and thus we are dedicated to connecting children with their ability to create and to express themselves.  No additional priority is given to zoned students for the Gifted & Talented program at this school. This school has ASD Nest: Open to students currently enrolled in the ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) Nest program.

This magnet school offers a school-wide curriculum around the theme of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics).
