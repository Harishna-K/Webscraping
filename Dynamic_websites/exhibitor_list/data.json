Unlike traditional helicopters, the GH-4 eliminates swashplates, gears and complex linkages, reducing maintenance and increasing reliability. With just two servos controlling flight, it offers an exceptional flight versatility, simplicity, and performance.\nScalability is at the core of Unmanned Aerospace. The GH-4 is designed to evolve into larger rotorcraft, making it adaptable for both military and commercial operations. Backed by the US Navy and OECIF, Unmanned Aerospace is pioneering the next generation of hydrogen-powered flight, integrating fuel cells and hybrid booster batteries for long-endurance missions.\nWith an optional JP-5 engine if hydrogen is not available, the GH-4 represents the future of mission-critical VTOL aircraft—combining endurance and efficiency in a scalable, next-gen platform.\nUnmanned Aerospace is committed to scaling this breakthrough technology to redefine aerial operations across military and commercial applications.",

Accipiter’s sensor agnosticism and advanced data fusion make airspace deconfliction and safety simplified for the remote pilot in command, so that they can focus on the mission at hand, whether it be infrastructure inspections, delivery missions and surveillance operations, or whether it concerns flying a single drone over a short distance or operating a fleet of drones nationwide. Our systems are specifically designed to provide automatic detection, tracking, and sophisticated alerting of intruder aircraft, including non-ADS-B aircraft, that enter the operational airspace of your drone allowing for swift and effective risk mitigation action. Moreover, Accipiter’s sophisticated mission analytics enable intelligence-led and data-driven programs, analyzing the safety and efficacy of every flight, to ensure safety and support continuous improvement.\n\nUsers can also monitor other drone activity in their airspace which they may be concerned with, using Accipiter’s user-friendly, web-based Common Operating Picture (COP) which provides real-time situational awareness and automated alerting to threats of interest 24/7/365. Geozone(s) can also be configured to automatically flag drones of concern for easy continuous monitoring.",

            "DESCRIPTION": "Pictorus is revolutionizing how engineers develop and deploy real-time control software, empowering teams to move faster and more efficiently without sacrificing performance or reliability. Traditionally, building complex industrial and embedded control systems requires deep expertise in low-level programming, time-consuming debugging, and extensive iteration cycles. Pictorus streamlines this process with a modern, high-level development environment designed for speed, flexibility, and ease of use.  \n\nWith Pictorus, engineers can visually design, simulate, and deploy high-performance control systems in a fraction of the time required by traditional approaches. The platform generates **optimized, hardware-ready C++ and Rust**, ensuring that engineers maintain complete control over their code, without the limitations of black-box solutions. By eliminating the need for extensive low-level programming, Pictorus allows teams to focus on **innovation and performance optimization** rather than getting bogged down in tedious implementation details.  \n\nDesigned for real-time, mission-critical applications, Pictorus is a game-changer for industries such as aerospace, robotics, automotive, and industrial automation. Whether developing guidance and navigation controls, robotic motion systems, or complex automation logic, engineers can leverage Pictorus to reduce development time drastically, minimize debugging efforts, and accelerate time-to-market**.  \n\nOne of Pictorus' key strengths is its intuitive, model-based design approach, which enables engineers to create complex, modular, and scalable control logic. Unlike traditional control system development, which often involves disconnected workflows and extensive hand-coding, Pictorus provides a seamless environment where engineers can design, test, and iterate faster than ever.  \n\nBy using Pictorus, companies can achieve more with smaller teams, optimize performance without compromising reliability, and gain a competitive edge in fast-moving industries. As the demand for smarter, more efficient control systems continues to rise, Pictorus sets a new standard for building real-time control software.  \n\nPictorus is the ultimate solution for engineers and companies looking to speed up development while maintaining precision and control.",

We focus on developing high-speed electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft using novel electric propulsion systems. Our core business sectors involve solutions for emergency logistics, surveillance, and disaster response in the advanced air mobility industry. We are actively engaging in research and development through government projects and partnerships.\n\nAirbility's flagship product is the AB-0, a high-speed unmanned eVTOL aircraft designed for surveillance and emergency logistics. The AB-0 was developed to meet the growing global demand for disaster response and urgent logistics solutions. The AB-0's application can be tailored for various industries, including wildfire monitoring, anti-drone operations, and ship resupply. The aircraft combines a unique fanjet electric propulsion technology with a hybrid energy system to achieve high-speed flight and extended endurance. Airbility's AB-0 offers unique advantages over competitors, including high-speed flight (up to 250 km/h) and vertical takeoff and landing capabilities for operation in confined spaces. Its low-noise fanjet propulsion system allows urban and suburban missions as well. Additionally, the aircraft is equipped with real-time data analysis and AI-based autonomous flight control systems for more efficient and safer operations.\n\nAirbility is targeting the U.S., Japan, and Southeast Asia as its key markets. We aim to enter these regions by providing solutions for disaster response, logistics, and security surveillance. We are seeking partnerships with government agencies and private companies involved in emergency response and logistics. Additionally, partners in infrastructure protection and security surveillance are also key targets.",

NanoFlowX coated servers withstood 300 hours of direct salt spray test while Parylene coated servers failed at under 100 hours.  \nWe offer up to 3 samples no charge and look forward to testing with you.",

In March 2023, Amprius made history as the first company to announce a 500 Wh/kg battery cell, setting a new standard in battery performance that was independently verified.\n\nWith an expanding customer base that includes the US Army, AeroVironment, Airbus, BAE Systems, Teledyne FLIR, and other leading aviation and eVTOL companies, Amprius has shipped approximately 50,000 cells to date. This customer demand underscores the industry's recognition of the superior performance offered by Amprius' next-generation SiMaxx™ batteries. \n\nIn January 2024, Amprius unveiled its latest innovation: SiCore™ batteries. These batteries are built on an innovative, proprietary material system that delivers high energy density and cycle life. With up to 400 Wh/kg and 1,200 cycles at full depth of discharge, SiCore™ batteries surpass the performance of state-of-the-art graphite cells. Amprius is able to offer these advanced cells in volume through exclusive volume supply agreements / toll manufacturing arrangements with its partners.\n\nLonger battery life is essential for maximizing the performance, efficiency, and adoption of electric mobility solutions on the land (EVs) and in the air (electric aircraft). Amprius' industry leading silicon anode batteries have the potential to revolutionize electric vehicle performance, enabling extended operating periods between recharges. By delivering longer range, accommodating heavier payloads, and enhancing operational efficiency, these batteries are poised to shape the future of electric mobility.",

Using this approach reduces kitting and layup time, reduces trim waste, and increased repeatable quality. Tailored Fiber Placement (TFP) is an embroidery-based tow-steering process that enables complete control over fiber placement and directionality in a composite preform.  During the process, continuous tow is stitched to a backing material using numerical control.  The result is highly engineered composite structures that take full advantage of the anisotropic nature of fiber reinforcement.",
