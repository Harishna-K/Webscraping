We value having teams that support our students and staff across all areas. There is an Equity Team, an ILT Team, an Early Childhood Division consisting of teachers and paras for 3K and Pre-K, and an SLT to name a few. We have many residencies to provide students with a wide range of experiences that take them out of the classroom and away from only the traditional academic core subjects. For example, there is a partnership with NDI, and the Horticultural Society, as well as Studio in a School. ",
