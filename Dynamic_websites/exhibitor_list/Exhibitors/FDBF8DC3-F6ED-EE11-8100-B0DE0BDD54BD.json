Radiometric color improves situational awareness, as shown by the wild boars running through heavy forestry. \r\n\r\nSightLine's AI Classifier has a model for vehicle or person - making it easier for an operator to identify what is happening in a scene. \r\n\r\nDrones tracking in real-time can have lots of turns, making it hard to view a scene.

SightLine's tracking and detection software features are optimized for small moving objects. \r\n\r\nThe use of picture in picture (PiP) helps improve situational awareness. The PiP helps bring a section of the scene in a larger view without taking away from the full scene.
