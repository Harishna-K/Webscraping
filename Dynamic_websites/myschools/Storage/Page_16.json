We are committed to creating an inclusive and supportive environment that empowers each student to reach their full potential and make meaningful contributions to society. Our unique programming features a structured 90-minute literacy block utilizing the HMH curriculum, which is aligned with the science of reading. We emphasize early foundational skills through the fidelity use of Heggerty and Foundations. Additionally, our well-structured 90-minute math program, using Envision, incorporates fact drills and S.O.L.V.E. strategies to enhance mathematical understanding. We conduct assessments through both formal methods, such as iReady and Acadience, and informal assessments, including checks for understanding. To foster parent engagement, we offer workshops, utilize Class Dojo and Google Classroom, provide a monthly calendar translated into multiple languages, and maintain an active social media presence. Through these initiatives, we aim to create a collaborative educational community dedicated to the success of all our students.",

This magnet school offers a school-wide curriculum around the theme of Inquiry and Expression. \"Welcome to P.S.189M: The Magnet School of Inquiry and Expression, where success for every child is the only option! We are a 3K-5 magnet school in the Washington Heights neighborhood of upper Manhattan with a proud 100-year history in our community.

At PS/IS 192, each student is special and precious.  Our school mission is to use every minute for every child to excel as a student and as a citizen. \n\nInstructional Bottom Lines\nWe will use student work and data to drive focused individualized instruction.  We will maintain a focused implementation of the workshop model in reading, writing, and math.  We will organize our learning environment to support our best teaching practices and student achievement.   We will use investigative methods to encourage inquiry-based learning in Math and Science. \n\nThe Engineering Design Process\n\nWhen conducting inquiry based learning and working on our STEAM projects, we follow the Engineering Design Process in which we: \nAsk: Students as questions that will help them reach their goal and think about their constraints.\nImagine: Students brainstorm ideas and choose the best one.\nPlan: Students sketch their idea and list the materials they will need.\nCreate: Students create a prototype of their idea and test to see if it works.\nImprove: Students reflect on ways to make improvements and make changes to their original idea.
