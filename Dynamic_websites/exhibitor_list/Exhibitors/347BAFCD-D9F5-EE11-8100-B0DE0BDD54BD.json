            "DESCRIPTION": "Founded in 2016 in Hood River, Oregon, Overwatch Imaging is a venture-backed small business with customers serving a wide variety of important missions around the world, from fire, flood, and emergency response to counter narcotics, border security, tactical intelligence, and maritime ISR. \nOverwatch Imaging develops sensor-agnostic software and purpose-built smart sensors that leverage the latest in artificial intelligence, computer vison, edge computing and sensor-band combination to automate the collection, analysis, and delivery of time-critical geospatial intelligence. Automated Sensor Operator (ASO) software works as an autopilot for imaging systems, automating otherwise time and labor-intensive tasks and freeing humans in the loop to focus less on the search and more on the best response.\nOverwatch Imaging has a strong track record of cross-platform compatibility, with its native line of smart sensors integrated on 24+ different crewed and uncrewed aircraft types and its ASO software compatible with a growing number of common sensor types.\nOverwatch Imaging is dedicated to supporting missions that matter by empowering decision-makers with time-critical geospatial intelligence as efficiently as possible.",
