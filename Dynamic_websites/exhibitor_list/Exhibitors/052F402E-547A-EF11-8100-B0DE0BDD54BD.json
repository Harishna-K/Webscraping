For these applications, we\u2019ve introduced the Xsens Vision Navigator.\r\n\r\nUsing dual RTK GNSS, an internal IMU and a camera, and visual-inertial odometry technology, the Xsens Vision Navigator provides accurate real-time navigation data, whether you\u2019re in a forest, an urban environment, a warehouse, a tunnel or even underground.\r\n\r\nWith the Vision Navigator, position drift is distance-dependent as opposed to time-dependent \u2013 as commonly found in more traditional GNSS/INS devices. Because of this, the Vision Navigator is able to cope with continuous GNSS disturbances or long-lasting GNSS outages.",
