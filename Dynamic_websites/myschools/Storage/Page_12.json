            "overview": "Magnet schools are public school options that provide a school-wide curriculum designed around a specific theme. They are intended to attract a diverse pool of applicants and historically have accommodated students from outside their zone or district. While some schools may have the word \"magnet\" in their school's name, only a school that currently gets Magnet Schools Assistance Program (M.S.A.P) funding is labeled as a \"magnet school\" on it's MySchools page. This magnet school offers a school-wide curriculum around the theme of Applied Life Sciences. PS/IS 121 is a little different than most schools you will visit.  We are an extremely small K-8 school, with two classes per grade and an average class size of 17 in our elementary school.  What does that mean for your school experience?  Our small size gives us the opportunity to get to know every child well and provide support and instruction that meet individual students' needs.  We are a Magnet School with a focus on applied science, which translates to lots of hands-on learning opportunities for your child.  Our strong academic program combined with the individualized support we provide has led to consistently high levels of academic achievement from our students, as evidenced by our test scores that are consistently above city averages.  Come check us out today! This school has ASD Nest: Open to students currently enrolled in the ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) Nest program. If you are applying to ASD programs for the first time, please visit www.schools.nyc.gov/specializedprograms for the application and contact ASDprograms@schools.nyc.gov with questions.",

            "overview": "Magnet schools are public school options that provide a school-wide curriculum designed around a specific theme. They are intended to attract a diverse pool of applicants and historically have accommodated students from outside their zone or district. While some schools may have the word \"magnet\" in their school's name, only a school that currently gets Magnet Schools Assistance Program (M.S.A.P) funding is labeled as a \"magnet school\" on it's MySchools page. This magnet school offers a school-wide curriculum around the theme of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics). AT PS 123K, WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ENGAGE AND INSPIRE ALL\nSTUDENTS TO RECOGNIZE AND REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL SO THAT THEY ARE EMPOWERED TO ACHIEVE THEIR PERSONAL AND ACADEMIC GOALS AS LIFELONG LEARNERS AND BECOME THE LEADERS THEY ARE DESTINED TO BE. \n\nStudent leaders are exposed to a combination of explicit instruction and problem based learning across content areas and the disciplines of STEAM as teachers provide access to content and use data to plan for student specific needs. With every decision, student leaders are kept at forefront ensuring they achieve the success they are capable of, NO EXCEPTIONS! ",

Our mission is to empower every child to reach their fullest potential while fostering a strong sense of belonging and community.\n\nWe pride ourselves on our innovative bilingual dual language programs, which not only promote language acquisition but also honor our students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cultural backgrounds. Our specialized programs are designed to meet the unique needs of bilingual special education and emotionally disturbed students, ensuring that every learner receives the support and resources they need to thrive.\n\nIn addition to our academic offerings, we cultivate a deep appreciation for the arts. Our programming includes visual arts, music, dance, and drama, providing students with multiple avenues for creative expression. As a proud Save the Music school, we are committed to ensuring that every child has the opportunity to explore their musical talents, whether through playing the violin or participating in our comprehensive music curriculum.\n\nTo further enrich our students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 experiences, we offer cultural enrichment opportunities on Saturdays, where students can engage in activities ranging from coding to exploring various art forms. These programs are designed to ignite curiosity and foster lifelong learning.\n\nWe are honored to be a beacon of excellence in the Highbridge community, providing a safe haven for students navigating the complexities of an urban environment. Together, we are committed to nurturing well-rounded individuals who are prepared to make meaningful contributions to our world. We invite you to join our community and experience the transformative journey of learning with us. This school has a Bilingual Special Education (BSE) program: Open to students recommended for Bilingual Special Education (BSE) on their Individualized Education Plan (IEP). If your child is recommended for BSE on their IEP and you have questions, visit www.schools.nyc.gov/specializedprograms or contact BSEprograms@schools.nyc.gov.  The Path Program provides support for students who have experienced trauma or stressful events, in an inclusive setting to learn in a district school alongside peers with and without IEPs. Students receive intensive behavioral and social emotional supports in the classroom and throughout the day by trained teachers, social workers and occupational therapists. Students in this program often have or are at risk of an educational classification of emotional disability. For more information, speak with your CSE or IEP team and refer to schools.nyc.gov/SpecializedPrograms.",

            "overview": "Our kindergarten program, both in our monolingual and dual language settings are designed to ensure that every student flourishes in their learning journey. Teaching and learning in kindergarten focuses on fostering a love for learning while supporting the development of social, emotional, cognitive, and physical skills. Activities are typically hands-on, which helps young children learn through exploration and experiences. Teachers facilitate learning by providing a variety of structured and unstructured activities that encourage curiosity, creativity, and foundational skills in literacy, numeracy and problem solving. We encourage children to take ownership of their learning by providing student choice and fostering a growth mindset. Developing social skills like sharing, taking turns, and empathy is also an essential part of our kindergarten curriculum as these skills are essential for future learning and personal growth. \n\nWe have established learning centers where students rotate through different activities. These centers cover various subjects, including math, science, art, and literacy, allowing children to experiment and explore in a fun and engaging way.\n\nOur program promotes collaboration through group projects and teamwork. By working together, students share ideas, solve problems, and learn from one another, fostering a strong sense of community within the classroom.\n  \nIn our kindergarten program, students engage in a variety of specialty subjects. They participate in Physical Education (PE), music, dance, visual arts, and media. Within the media curriculum, students also explore coding and robotics, introducing them to important skills in technology. \n This school has a Bilingual Special Education (BSE) program: Open to students recommended for Bilingual Special Education (BSE) on their Individualized Education Plan (IEP). If your child is recommended for BSE on their IEP and you have questions, visit www.schools.nyc.gov/specializedprograms or contact BSEprograms@schools.nyc.gov. ",
