            "overview": "In 1992, teachers in Manhattan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s East Village founded the Earth School on a dream: to create a peaceful, nurturing place to stimulate learning in all areas of child development-- intellectual, social, emotional, artistic, and physical. Today it is a vibrant community of pre-kindergarten through 5th grade Earthlings, with a teaching staff dedicated to the founding values of hands-on exploration, an arts-rich curriculum, responsible stewardship of the Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resources, harmonious resolution of conflict, and parent-teacher partnership.\n\nEarth School teachers believe in a \"child-centered\" approach that considers children's individual experiences, identities, and relationships to be essential factors in knowing how best to support their learning and growth. While engaging in rich learning experiences in the academic content areas, our Earthlings are encouraged to explore, experiment, and even sometimes make a mess in the pursuit of learning. From PreK to 5th grade, children engage in countless field trips, ranging from walking trips to visit the many cultural resources in our own neighborhood, to overnight trips in our upper grades to engage in extended learning experiences in outdoor education. \n\nEarth School families come from diverse cultural, ethnic and economic backgrounds, and our school emphasizes community building and inclusivity--differences are celebrated as key to the richness of our school, city, and world communities.  \n\nNotes: \nWe offer an on-site after school option for PreK-5th grade families, and coordinate with neighborhood afterschool providers for a variety of after school programs that serve K-5th grade students. \n\nEnrollment in a public elementary does not guarantee school bus service. For more information please visit schools.nyc.gov/BusEligibility.\n\nPriority is given to applicants living in temporary housing, who are English Language Learners, and/or eligible for Free and Reduced Lunch (based on family income) for a percentage of seats based on the applicant pool. Students who do not fall into any of these groups will get a priority for the remaining percentage of offers.",
