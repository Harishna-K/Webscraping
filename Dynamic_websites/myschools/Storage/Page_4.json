            "overview": "PS 14 The Fairview School is located in the Heart of Corona. Founded in 1914, we have deep connections to Queens, rich with history and tradition. Do you know why our school is named \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Fairview School\u00e2\u0080\u009d? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because we had a view of the World\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fairs in 1939 and 1964. The \u00e2\u0080\u009939 theme was \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe World of Tomorrow\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and the \u00e2\u0080\u009964 theme was \"Peace through Understanding\" dedicated to \"Man's Achievement on a Shrinking Globe in an Expanding Universe\". We embrace those themes, and we recently rebranded ourselves as a \"Sustainable STEAM School\" with STEM themed classes, a heavy emphasis on the arts, and a hydroponics lab with Family Gardening Hour. We are a Billion Oyster School, and every child takes both engineering and computer science every single year. \n\nAt PS 14 we believe that all children have talents and strengths. We strive to engage all students in enriching and inspiring ways. All students take at least one semester of the following courses EVERY year from kindergarten through fifth grade: dance, theater, music/piano, engineering, computer science 4 all, and \"SEL through Visual Arts\". We believe in kindness and courage, and we believe that adults and children alike are ultimately responsible for our own learning, growth, and improvement. As a Leader in Me school, we practice 8 Habits of Highly Effective People with a goal of \u00e2\u0080\u009cowning our own learning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Students have voice and choice in their learning, and we partner with parents \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the people who know their children best \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to best support all students. A variety of Saturday programs run all school-year long for adults, teens, and PS 14 students including a robust cadets program. \n\nOur arts department is our pride and joy. Our PS 14 Star Choir broadcast locally and nationally on the 2022 Rockefeller Tree Lighting Special. Our band, choir, and theater kids are invited all over the city to perform, including recently: Carnegie Hall, The Queens Borough Arts Fair, The Department of Education Tweed Building, Queens Museum, Queens Borough Hall, the 110 Precinct Events, and the annual Corona Tree Lighting. Our musical theater department puts up shows annually, and recently performed High School Musical Jr, Aladdin Jr., Frozen Jr., and our 2025 show is Moana Jr. Come and watch us perform at 5 pm on June 12 and June 13, 2025!\n\nWe are a UFT Community School, offering wrap around services for members of our community, including ESL classes for adults, an after-school Beacon program (until 6 pm, grades 1-5 only), and after school clubs for our upper grade students. K -2 students engage in gradewide clubs during the school day. \n\nWe value our Sustainable STEAM theme. Our Annual STEM Expo is a highlight every March.  In addition to our Hydroponics Lab, we have one of the only Black Box Theaters in any NYC elementary school. Our dance studio with wood floors, ballet barres, and mirrors is currently being built. We have a Computer Science Lab (including robots to code), an Engineering Lab with 3D printers, a Visual Arts Room, and a Music and the Brain Keyboard Lab. Our main theater is newly renovated with a new stage, and our library is undergoing an upgrade as well to include comfortable seating and a place for students to read or study during lunchtime. Oh, and we have two small soccer pitches and a 1/20 mile track in our backyard. \n\nNext up: we are building a Play Garden with room for three outdoor classrooms and on the corner of 108th and Martense. The plan is to open this space in the fall of 2026.\n\nAnd there is so much more that we offer our students and our families. To learn more, please visit us at www.PS14Fairview.org and follow us on Instagram at PS14Fairview. \n\nWe can't wait to meet you!\n\n This school has a Bilingual Special Education (BSE) program: Open to students recommended for Bilingual Special Education (BSE) on their Individualized Education Plan (IEP).

Through data driven instruction students will engage in diverse learning opportunities to become lifelong learners. Our commitment extends to community and parent collaboration to develop the social, emotional, and educational lives of all students. The Autism Horizon Program supports students with autism in a special class with eight students, a special education teacher and paraprofessional with emphasis on building skills and offering opportunities for meaningful inclusion in larger settings. Students in this program may need additional academic support and require speech and language services, including in areas of social or pragmatic communication. For more information, speak with your CSE or IEP team and refer to Specialized Programs for Students with Disabilities (nyc.gov).",

We are shifting the teaching and learning to an exploratory style such as the 5 Mathematical Practices, where students are working together to explore new concepts and teachers are monitoring and building on student's strengths. We have collaborations with St. Nicks Alliance, who is our CBO after school program, Volo: a young sports organization, a soccer program, Painted Cloud Arts organization where students engage in project based learning, and so much. Our teachers and staff work in a learning environment where we lean on each other for support during our teacher and staff team meetings. We utilize the Child Mind Institute social emotional learning curriculum for our students, teachers and staff. We have a strong Student Council made up of students from Kindergarten through 5th grade with students elected to positions such as President, Historian, Secretary, etc. This 2024-2025 school year, our Student Council are leading initiatives that will decide our new school logo, school color, uniform shirt, work with the city to install a speed bump on our street, and so much more. We are a small school looking to grow in not only student performance but in size. Come and join the movement! \n",

We pride ourselves on being a hub of the community at large offering robust services to both students and families.  We are a United Community School offering support to families in the form of food pantries, clothing closets, dental services and mental health services. Although we are the largest elementary school in NY, we create a family like culture though our monthly family events, parent workshops, and close Parent Association collaboration. We have afterschool programs Monday-Friday ranging from academic to extracurricular to ensure we are enriching the whole child. Our goal is to expose students to various, impactful experiences inside and outside of school to prepare students for their future.  Through our academic programs, school initiatives and strong community partnerships we aim to send students to middle school ready to begin college or career planning for a future of their choice. This school has a Bilingual Special Education (BSE) program: Open to students recommended for Bilingual Special Education (BSE) on their Individualized Education Plan (IEP). If your child is recommended for BSE on their IEP and you have questions, visit www.schools.nyc.gov/specializedprograms or contact BSEprograms@schools.nyc.gov. ",
