            "overview": "Magnet schools are public school options that provide a school-wide curriculum designed around a specific theme. They are intended to attract a diverse pool of applicants and historically have accommodated students from outside their zone or district. While some schools may have the word \"magnet\" in their school's name, only a school that currently gets Magnet Schools Assistance Program (M.S.A.P) funding is labeled as a \"magnet school\" on it's MySchools page. This magnet school offers a school-wide curriculum around the theme of Global Studies and Leadership. At PS/MS 200: The Magnet School of Global Studies & Leadership, students graduate with a profound appreciation for diversity, an understanding of the challenges facing people around the world, and the skills that will enable them to effect change in the 21st century. \n\nThrough an emphasis on global competence and geographic literacy, our students learn to be innovators and leaders in the world community. They use multimedia and computer technology as tools to gather, organize, analyze, and create digital content and as platforms to communicate with students and families across the globe. \n\nOur school integrates global studies and leadership seamlessly into the core subjects, and students in our upper grades are also able to pursue \"Enrichment Courses\" through the School-wide Enrichment Model. Teachers, staff developers, and school leaders work together to create a 3K-8 Scope & Sequence for Global Studies and Leadership that incorporates the NYC Scope & Sequences for Science and Social Studies. \n\nThe overarching goals of our Magnet program are to promote acceptance and diversity, to create learning opportunities that engage students in problem solving at the global level, and to produce future leaders who want to make a difference. Our school challenges students to consider the important question: How can I become a leader in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world? ",

They are intended to attract a diverse pool of applicants and historically have accommodated students from outside their zone or district. While some schools may have the word \"magnet\" in their school's name, only a school that currently gets Magnet Schools Assistance Program (M.S.A.P) funding is labeled as a \"magnet school\" on it's MySchools page. This magnet school offers a school-wide curriculum around the theme of Global Conservation and Service Learning. Enrollment in kindergarten to sixth grade in a public elementary does not guarantee school bus service. For more information please visit schools.nyc.gov/BusEligibility. The Intensive Reading Education and Development (IREAD) program is a literacy program, in an integrated co-teaching setting where students receive focused and individualized instruction through a reading intervention that is provided during all subjects to support literacy, language, and speech skills. For more information, speak with your CSE or IEP team and refer to schools.nyc.gov/SpecializedPrograms.",

Our school is comprised of 53% Hispanic students, 36% African American students and 6% White students. 54% of our students are female and 46% are male. Our ELL population is 7% and 30% of our students receive special education services. In addition to our academic program, we offer students opportunities to explore art, music, dance, and theater. We have long standing partnerships with organizations like the Asphalt Green, 92nd St YMCA, which allow our students to experience chorus, theater, ceramics, and swimming as part of their weekly schedule. We believe that exploration of art, music, dance, and theater will help them find at least one area they are passionate about for life. As a small school, we are able to establish a close-knit community and culture. Our teachers are able to get to know students as individuals, both the students they teach and students in other classes as well. We meet as a school each week for our \"Town Meeting,\" where we sing songs, share work, and talk about community issues.",
