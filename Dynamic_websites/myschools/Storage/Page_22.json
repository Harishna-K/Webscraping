            "overview": "PS 506 is located in south Brooklyn's vibrant Sunset Park Community.  We believe that students learn best when educators create a safe, risk-free academic environment. Teachers provide meaningful, relevant, and challenging instruction by offering differentiated entry points, modeling expected outcomes and providing clear and specific next steps.  Students receive multiple opportunities to work collaboratively with peers. Students receive a well-rounded education with special programs, such as theater, and technology during the school day. PS 506 offers a Spanish dual language program for students in kindergarten through fifth grades. \n\nStudents also have opportunities to engage in enrichment activities after school including running and soccer clubs, theater, STEAM and robotic classes. Families are welcome to the school for events such as Family Fun Days. Families are able to participate in fun classroom activities with their children.  The PTA also hosts monthly meetings with student performances.\n\nPS 506 is a Leader in Me school, which teaches students, parents and staff about the, \"Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,\" by Stephen Covey.  Students learn how to, \"Be proactive; begin with the end in mind; put first things first; think win-win; seek first to understand, then to be understood; synergize; sharpen the saw.\"  These life skills help students set high expectations for themselves to be leaders so that they prioritize work, set goals for themselves, work well with others by listening, and balance elements of life.  Students have an opportunity to set personal and academic goals and monitor and track their progress.  Teachers assist in this process by modeling these processes and providing feedback around their goals and action plans.  PS 506 received Lighthouse Certification after outside reviewers observed the school using an extensive rubric to assess the integration of habits within our school community.  PS 506 was re-certified as a Lighthouse school in 2018.\n\nAs a Community School, PS 506 offers many services to our students and families, including our School Based Health and Dental clinic in partnership with NYU Langone.  PS 506 also works closely with Center for Family Life in partnership with the Office of Community Schools to provide additional support, such as after school academic and enrichment programming for students.\n\nPS 506 works with many outside organizations . Some classes were partnered with Brooklyn Connections.  This program is designed to make the research process fun and accessible for students and educators. Fully aligned with the New York State Next Generation Learning Standards, Brooklyn Connections anchors students in the 21st Century learning skills needed in order to achieve academic success in school and beyond. Students at PS 506 also enjoy a full arts program.  We participate in Disney Musical in Schools Program in which students prepare and implement a full musical production.  PS 506 has partnered with Arts Connection as well as Dance Wave.  Teaching artists visit weekly and provide art residencies to all students in visual arts, dance, and drumming.",
