            "overview": "A new school opening in Fall 2024. Growing out of the progressive education model of Brooklyn New School comes P.S.456, offering inquiry-based curriculum centering exploration, problem-solving, and becoming change agents. We maintain a racial, ethnic and economic balance, where children engage in active learning together with peers of different skill levels and active collaboration with families. Enrollment in pre-k and Kindergarten growing year by year to fifth grade. For information about busing please visit schools.nyc.gov/BusEligibility. For more information about this school, please visit schools.nyc.gov/K This school gives priority to applicants eligible for Free or Reduced Price Lunch (based on family income) for 50% of seats. Our educational framework and mission stem from our inquiry based curriculum, which enables students to problem solve and effect change. They apply knowledge gained in school to real life situations. Students develop projects with teachers in and outside of the classroom.\n\nWe are committed to education which emphasizes cooperation rather than competition. We foster a school community - students, families, teachers and administrators - where every intersection of diversity is uniquely acknowledged and celebrated each and every day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in what our students learn and how they interact with one another; and how our teachers and parents engage, with a shared purpose: student success. \n\nWe strive to create an inclusive culture where listening and acceptance creates the truest sense of belonging; where we challenge the paradigms and perceived notions of equality and equity where we speak up for and against any forms and acts of racism; where we manifest the deepest and most profound new reality where all of our differences, whether ethnicity, race, gender preference, sexual orientation, physical ability, age, religious beliefs, language preference or socio-economic status are a reflection of the beautiful tapestry of this community. As a connected community nurturing our future curious, lifelong learners, we never tire of our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nThis is a strong collaborative partnership with Brooklyn New School. This includes the sharing of resources to build capacity in staff with on-going professional development and intervisitations. Project-based learning will be centered, and social justice practices and curriculum will be crucial to build off the powerful work and legacy of BNS.\n\n For more information about this school, please visit schools.nyc.gov/K",

We proudly serve students from 3K to Grade 5 and are committed to creating a nurturing and inspiring environment.\n\nFounded in 2011 by Jermaine L. Green, our school started with a vision for students to grow into strong readers, writers, and thinkers while becoming tech-savvy. Even after Mr. Green's passing in 2013, we continue to embrace his vision by providing engaging opportunities in science, technology, engineering, arts, and math, empowering our students to express their voices and become leaders.\n\nAt PS 354Q, we offer a challenging yet supportive curriculum tailored to meet the needs of all our students. Our inclusive classrooms foster a sense of belonging as students participate in both small and large group activities. We encourage self-sufficiency and independent thinking through collaborative discussions and exciting STEM projects. As students progress to the upper grades, they can choose to major in one of our four STEM fields. We also provide dual language classes, helping students become biliterate and bilingual in Spanish and English.\n\nOur vibrant community includes dedicated educators and staff from diverse backgrounds, all committed to helping every child reach their full potential. With a variety of languages spoken among our staff, including Spanish, Haitian Creole, and Bangla, we celebrate our differences and work together to support our students.\n\nWe invite you to explore our website to learn more about our mission, values, and amazing programs. Together, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s embark on this wonderful journey of learning and growth!
