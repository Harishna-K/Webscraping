As the largest elementary school in NYC district 9, we provide a holistic educational experience that is difficult to replicate in a public education setting. By incorporating a socially responsive curriculum, we promote rich student discussion while integrating innovative STEM practices. This only happens at THE MAX; where a creative, caring, community nurtures the future innovators of tomorrow.  The Path Program provides support for students who have experienced trauma or stressful events, in an inclusive setting to learn in a district school alongside peers with and without IEPs. Students receive intensive behavioral and social emotional supports in the classroom and throughout the day by trained teachers, social workers and occupational therapists. Students in this program often have or are at risk of an educational classification of emotional disability. For more information, speak with your CSE or IEP team and refer to schools.nyc.gov/SpecializedPrograms. The Intensive Reading Education and Development (IREAD) program is a literacy program, in an integrated co-teaching setting where students receive focused and individualized instruction through a reading intervention that is provided during all subjects to support literacy, language, and speech skills. For more information, speak with your CSE or IEP team and refer to schools.nyc.gov/SpecializedPrograms.",
