We celebrate the tremendous diversity of our community and celebrate each child's uniqueness. We strive to prioritize inclusion throughout the day, ensuring that every student has access to the greatest opportunity of learning for every individual child.\n\nEach day students engage in a focused literacy block with emphasis on building early phonics, reading fluency, and a rich vocabulary. The school curriculum includes social emotional learning with their units of study\n\nWe believe arts are vital to student success and students in every grade get to participate in a form of art whether it is dance, music, or visual arts. We, at PS171, develop a well rounded child preparing them for success in their future! The Autism Horizon Program supports students with autism in a special class with eight students, a special education teacher and paraprofessional with emphasis on building skills and offering opportunities for meaningful inclusion in larger settings. Students in this program may need additional academic support and require speech and language services, including in areas of social or pragmatic communication. For more information, speak with your CSE or IEP team and refer to Specialized Programs for Students with Disabilities (nyc.gov).",
