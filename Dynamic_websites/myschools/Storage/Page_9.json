            "overview": "PS 87 is a PK-5 primary school serving families on the Upper West Side. As a school, we recognize that to advance each student through their individualized instructional path, we must teach - and know - the whole child. By encouraging our community members to follow our four tenets - be kind, wise, brave, and honest - we hope to promote inclusion and acceptance academically, socially, and emotionally. \n\nTo achieve our mission, we teach students through deep, thematic units of study heavily steeped in science and social studies.  Through these units, students can apply the skills they have learned in literacy and mathematics as they also learn to think critically about the world around them using multiple learning modalities.  To enrich the children's academic experience at PS 87, we have partnerships with the National Dance Institute, Dancing Classrooms, Center for Architecture, Symphony Space, Art Farm, Ajna Dance, and Jazz a Lincoln Center.",

            "overview": "P.S. 91 is a Performing Arts Elementary School in the University Heights section of the Bronx serving approximately 360 students in grades K-5. Principal Nasjletti has been leading the school for 15 years.  It is presently a school in good standing in terms of NYSED accountability. We provide General Education, Special Education (ICT, Self-Contained, and Horizon), English as a New Language (ENL), and Bilingual classroom settings. We provide mandated services that include ENL support, counseling, SETSS, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and mono and bilingual speech therapy. Student attendance is our top priority. The school's attendance goal is to reach 100%.\n\nSPECIAL INITIATIVES: \n\nARTS: We are very proud of our ever-growing Arts program. We offer classes in visual and performing arts, including music, art, theater, and dance.  Our certified music teacher organizes concerts in the Winter and Spring that are enjoyed by the entire school community, including parents and elected officials. Our certified art teacher provides instruction in art which includes painting, drawing, designing, and photography. Our Arts program is also supported by outside partnerships including  dancing Classrooms, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Rosie\u2019s Theater Kids, Young People's Chorus of NYC, and Materials for the Arts. These art programs have had a positive impact on parental involvement and increased the opportunities to invite parents into our school. Besides the Arts, we offer academic,  chess, soccer, and basketball after-school programs. The Autism Horizon Program supports students with autism in a special class with eight students, a special education teacher and paraprofessional with emphasis on building skills and offering opportunities for meaningful inclusion in larger settings. Students in this program may need additional academic support and require speech and language services, including in areas of social or pragmatic communication. For more information, speak with your CSE or IEP team and refer to Specialized Programs for Students with Disabilities (nyc.gov).",

Parents trust their most precious children to schools for various reasons.  Send your child to Bethune because our Bethune family truly cares for children.  We are a small, tight knit school with staff who are committed to enriching the lives of children.  Our mission is aligned to the legacy of Mary McLeod Bethune to encourage our youth, recognize their potential, and to help them build a better world.  A feeling of belonging is important to us and we recognize and celebrate the diversity within our school building.  We expose all students to performance arts and visual arts in addition to their daily academics.  We believe in health and wellness for students as well as staff.  At Bethune, your child will be known by name by all and greeted warmly daily.  We will communicate with you often and invite you in to learn alongside us. New York City helps to shape our classrooms.  Our students experience a number of field trips aligned to our curriculum and health and wellness.  We invite you to make outreach to set up a tour of our beautiful school. The Autism Horizon Program supports students with autism in a special class with eight students, a special education teacher and paraprofessional with emphasis on building skills and offering opportunities for meaningful inclusion in larger settings. Students in this program may need additional academic support and require speech and language services, including in areas of social or pragmatic communication. For more information, speak with your CSE or IEP team and refer to Specialized Programs for Students with Disabilities (nyc.gov).",
